# GPL3 issues

I noticed that on after writing the first version of the English article, this projects license was invalidated and now does not display as GNU General Public License v3.0. I was not told what violates the license, I am wondering if it was an attack on this project from GitHub, as I might have upset their algorithm. I would like to know the offending content that de-licensed this project, as all my other anti-Google products still have their GNU GPL3 license enabled.

Update: February 23rd 2021: as of 4:57 pm, I checked the info, and it is now labeled as "other" I am not sure if this is due to this post. It isn't licensed as "other" it is still completely GNU 3.
